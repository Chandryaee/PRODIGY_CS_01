As the first task of the internship, we have created a python program that is used to show the principalities of the Caeser Cipher Algorithm which is one of the first Substitution Algorithms in the field of Cryptography, created by Julius Caeser himself. It is a simple encryption algorithm that shifts a value by 3 spaces up, and the decryption is done accordingly.
Encryption Algorithm (c): (p + k) mod 26 and
Decryption Algorithm (p): (c - k) mod 26
(where, c = ciphertest
       p = plantext
       k = key)
